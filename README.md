A C++ implementation of the Modern C++ examples in AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features (https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features).

This is to be a learning tool for people wanting to run and play with the new features in a compilable state.


TODO
=======
Some sections are still missing for some new features in C++17 and some more thorough commenting to match the source examples.

Need to add random and chrono and new timer parts among other things.

Unit tests could be added to use this all together for simple compliance testing.


USAGE
=======
Current defines are:

#define USE_CPP11
#define USE_CPP14
#define USE_CPP17
#define MSVC_NOT_SUPPORTED_ENABLED

To enable the features from each version and enable and disable the features currently not supported through VS2017.
